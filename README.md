# Supermarket_Sales_Data_Analysis_Using_Python_and_PowerBI

Here, I analysed a data of supermarket sales namely 'supermarket_sales _data.csv' using Python and PowerBI. To do so, I firstly cleaned and preprocessed the data using Python and finally, created a dashboard on PowerBI showing various visualizations to gain the insights of data for further analysis. 

Also, I created a Pie-Chart namely 'Payment type Distribution' on the dashboard by integrating Python code into the PowerBI.
